陵墓
[blockend:header]

[blockstart:00_start1] 
我们在完成神像的建设过后。西加哥德和哈迪已经先我们一步出发，前往了哈利卡纳苏。

在很久以前，那里有一座辉煌的建筑。一位著名国王的陵墓，非常的壮丽雄伟。

然后在漫长的几百年后。国王的名字已经被世人所遗忘了，建筑一直保留着下来。但是近期的数次地震，也让陵墓遭受了很大的损失。
[blockend:00_start1]


[blockstart:00_start2] 
重建陵墓是我们的目前最紧急的任务！！如果运气好的话，这应该只是一个短时间的问题，因为安理会认为，数次的地震并没有显著影响到陵墓的地基，只是部分结构损坏罢了。

哈迪和西加哥德率先在城市的北方落脚。他们想先拜访哈利卡纳苏的统治者，并调查该市的情况。有了罗德岛的经历，他们变得更为谨慎了，跟拜占庭人的冲突。很多人失去了珍贵的生命。

前往哈利卡纳苏并拜访君主。

在阿特米西亚女王的帮助下，尽管有海盗和地震，我们还是成功地将陵墓修复！！

我们现在只能希望，在我们完成我们的伟大使命之前，这个世界奇观能免受任何灾难。让世界重回美好！

[blockend:09_end_text1]

[blockstart:09_end_text2] 

我们的旅程现在将带我们去以弗所，在那里我们想看看阿尔忒弥斯神庙是否完好无损。

这是国际理事会告诉我们的。我们希望旅途能一路平安，虽然黑暗和邪恶在日益增长。但是，祝我们好运！！

毕竟，我们已经没有别的选择了.....

哈利卡纳苏斯

这是哈利卡纳苏斯，加勒比海地区的首都。这座城市位于一个受近海岛屿保护的天然港口周围。

卡里亚地区的统治者是毛索洛斯国王。我们必须去拜访他，了解这片地区的状况，看看在重建古代国王陵墓的过程中我们是否会遇到任何麻烦。

同时，我们想寻找古墓的遗迹。毕竟，他们肯定就在这儿的某个地方。。。

一个曾经来自遥远埃及的部落在哈利卡纳苏城附近定居下来。他们以埃及冥界之神的名字称自己为奥西里亚人，身为神的后裔，他们很排斥外来人士。

他们守护着近山区发现的资源。不让外人涉足任何一步。

如果我们想跟哈利卡纳苏斯地区的人有进一步合作，我们就必须赶走奥西里亚人，或者想办法和他们交朋友。取得三方共赢的局面。

赶走奥西里人或支付要求的贡品，这样他们就会放弃对你部落的敌对态度。

拉纳巴拉 部落

拉纳巴拉 的人民生活在哈利卡纳苏以西的一个岛屿上。他们是通过抢劫和袭击谋生的海盗。

他们是天生的战士，他们用船控制着周边的领土，他们掌控着海域！！没有人能免受他们的袭击。

我们必须谨慎的与他们接触，避免成为他们索求黄金的对象。。。

做好防范海盗袭击的准备。也许你可以买到和平，但是。。短暂的和平带来不了任何的平安。

曼尼的重病迫使我们离开了朋友。

我们离开罗兹后，当我们到达赛拉的父亲拜占庭皇帝的宫廷时，他尽其所能为我们找到了帝国最好的医生。因此，马尼享受了人们所能想象到的最好的医疗服务。
多亏了这种精心的护理，他很快就康复了。尽管如此，我们还是一直呆在球场上，直到他完全康复。

然后我们准备好了我们的船，再次启程前往罗德斯。但当我们从远处看到港口入口处的巨像时，我们知道我们的朋友们取得了成功，并一直直接驶向哈利卡纳苏。
我们来了！

我们很容易一起完成下一个世界奇迹！

如果我们没有错就好了。。。

One of the Osirian priests by the name of Tut Ma' Nix offered us his help.

<usericon:2,150>

"Friends, I have heard about your great heroic deeds! I have also been told that you are accompanied by a boy who has a dragon! 

I can hardly believe such words! But if the rumour is true, send both of them to me, so I can have a look at them! If I were to witness such a miracle, I would reveal the great secret of the Osirians!"

Thank you for revealing this miracle to me! In return you shall know about the secret paths of the Osirians. We rarely use them, but they may be of advantage to you ... I will open them for you ...

Listen! Through this magic gate you will get to the island of Al Rhababa:

The survivors were pleading for leniency and peace. They surrendered and lay their fate in our hands.

Retaliation was not what we had in mind. We loved peace, and now that the pirates had given in, we made peace with them. 

We were sure that, from now on, they were no threat to us any more.

How often have the pirates of Al Rhababa landed here and plundered the city! Although we specially built this stronghold on the promontory in the harbour ... 

But apparently our soldiers are not in a position to fight the pirate ships from there ...

So, you had better keep away from here ... I don't want you to be harmed!"

You are looking for the tomb of the old king? Hm. Well, it did once exist, up on the hill over there. 

We have used the stones to build new houses in the city. They served us well.

We have created a little park on the spot where it once stood. For the citizens to relax. So you see the old tomb still serves a good cause, even after all this time. 

Well, that's enough now. After all, I am the king and not a tourist guide! Send your leader if there is anything else you would like to talk about!

"WHAT? You want to rebuild the ancient tomb? Did I hear you right? 
That is a huge project indeed! And not without problems, even though, as you say, the welfare of all mankind depends on it.

You should know that we have built a nice park for our citizens on the spot where the tomb used to be. For rest and relaxation. And this park is my beloved wife's favourite spot!

She will be so upset if I tear down the park! She would never forgive me!
