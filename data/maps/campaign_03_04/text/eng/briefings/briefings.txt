THE MAUSOLEUM
[blockend:header]

[blockstart:00_start1] 
After the successful construction of the Colossus, Sigurd and Hatchie had set off to Halicarnassus with the rest of the company. In ancient times there used to be a mighty building somewhere near this port that served as a tomb to a famous king.

In the course of the centuries, the name of the king had fallen into oblivion, and even the building itself was said to have been destroyed in an earthquake. 
[blockend:00_start1]


[blockstart:00_start2] 
It was our task to resurrect the tomb. With a little bit of luck it should only be a matter of a short time, for according to the Council, the foundations at least still existed.


Hatchie and Sigurd dropped anchor north of the city. First they wanted to pay a visit to the ruler of Halicarnassus and investigate the situation in the city. After what they had experienced in Rhodes, they had become cautious ...


Go to Halicarnassus and pay the monarch a visit.

MISSION COMPLETED! 
[blockend:09_end_header]

[blockstart:09_end_text1] 
You made it! 

With Queen Artemisia's help, we had managed to complete the Mausoleum despite pirates and earthquakes!
 
We could now only hope that this Wonder of the World would be spared from any catastrophes until we had completed our great mission.
[blockend:09_end_text1]

[blockstart:09_end_text2] 
Our journey would now take us to Ephesus, where we wanted to see whether the Temple of Artemis was still undamaged and intact. 

This was what the Council of Nations had told us. We were hoping that we wouldn't receive a nasty surprise, because evil and darkness were coming closer and closer. 


We had no time to lose ...

[blockstart:10] 
HALICARNASSUS

This is Halicarnassus, the capital of the Carian region. The city is located around a natural harbour that is protected by an offshore island. 

The ruler of the Carian region was King Mausolos. We had to see him to find out whether we would face any troubles during the reconstruction of the Mausoleum of the ancient king. 

At the same time, we wanted to look out for remains of the ancient tomb. After all, they had to be somewhere ...

[blockstart:11] 
TRIBE OF THE OSIRIANS

<usericon:1,83,83>

A tribe that once came from distant Egypt had settled down near the city of Halicarnassus. They called themselves Osirians after the Egyptian god of the underworld.

Enviously and energetically they defended the resources that they found in the mountains near their village.

If we wanted to lay hands on them, we would have to drive away the Osirians or find a way to make friends with them.


Drive the Osirians away or pay the requested tribute, so that they will give up their hostile attitude towards your tribe.

// Al Rhababa 
[blockstart:12] 
AL RHABABA

The people of Al Rhababa lived on an island to the west of Halicarnassus. They were pirates who made their living through robbery and raids.

They were men of war and could quickly cover large distances with their ships! Nobody was safe from their raids. We, too, feared to become the victims of their greed for gold ...


Prepare yourself against raids by the pirates. Maybe you can buy peace and thus prevent them from robbing you.
[blockend:12]


[blockstart:13] 
EL ARAB

At the foot of the mountains lived a small tribe called El Arab. They regarded the mountains as their possessions and attacked anyone who tried to settle there.


Maybe you can manage to break their hostile attitude by paying them a tribute ...

FRIENDS ARRIVE

It was a big surprise when the ship carrying myself, Cyra, our son Mani, his dragon Norbert and some soldiers from Cyra's father's bodyguard dropped anchor at the beach!

<usericon:1,173,34>

Mani had recovered from his severe illness that had forced us to leave our friends. 

When we had arrived at the court of Cyra's father, the Emperor of Byzantium, after our departure from Rhodes, he did everything in his power to get the best physicians of the empire. So, Mani enjoyed the best medical care one could imagine. 

Thanks to this excellent care and nursing he had soon recovered. Still, we had remained at the court until he was completely well again. 

Then we had prepared our ship and set off again for Rhodes. But when we saw the Colossus in the harbour entrance from a distance, we knew that our friends had been successful and kept sailing directly towards Halicarnassus. 

And here we were!

Together it would be easy for us to complete the next Wonder of the World!


If only we were not mistaken ...

You have shown a hostile attitude towards the people of Halicarnassus!

PRIEST TUT MA' NIX

One of the Osirian priests by the name of Tut Ma' Nix offered us his help.

<usericon:2,150>

"Friends, I have heard about your great heroic deeds! I have also been told that you are accompanied by a boy who has a dragon! 

I can hardly believe such words! But if the rumour is true, send both of them to me, so I can have a look at them! If I were to witness such a miracle, I would reveal the great secret of the Osirians!"


Send Mani and Norbert to Tut Ma' Nix.

When Tut Ma' Nix saw Mani and Norbert, his eyes started glowing!

<usericon:2,150>

"Oh, what miracle I am witnessing! A real dragon! Led by an ordinary Northland boy! May Osiris bless you and close the gates to his realm for you for many years to come!

Thank you for revealing this miracle to me! In return you shall know about the secret paths of the Osirians. We rarely use them, but they may be of advantage to you ... I will open them for you ...

Listen! Through this magic gate you will get to the island of Al Rhababa:

<usericon:1,26,129>

PIRATES DEFEATED!

Our brave heroes finally managed to defeat the pirates of Al Rhababa!

The survivors were pleading for leniency and peace. They surrendered and lay their fate in our hands.

Retaliation was not what we had in mind. We loved peace, and now that the pirates had given in, we made peace with them. 

We were sure that, from now on, they were no threat to us any more.

Take these goods. I give them to you. Maybe they will be of use.

How often have the pirates of Al Rhababa landed here and plundered the city! Although we specially built this stronghold on the promontory in the harbour ... 

But apparently our soldiers are not in a position to fight the pirate ships from there ...

So, you had better keep away from here ... I don't want you to be harmed!"

"Shhhh ... Do you know what they say in the tavern? The Osirians have secret ways of travelling from one spot to the next in a split second! In no time at all, so to speak. As if by magic!

He supposedly also likes really strange animals. Unicorns, sphinxes, minotaurs, dragons and such ...

You are looking for the tomb of the old king? Hm. Well, it did once exist, up on the hill over there. 

We have used the stones to build new houses in the city. They served us well.

We have created a little park on the spot where it once stood. For the citizens to relax. So you see the old tomb still serves a good cause, even after all this time. 

Well, that's enough now. After all, I am the king and not a tourist guide! Send your leader if there is anything else you would like to talk about! 

Otherwise - please excuse me!"

If it's true, you must be very rich and well-off. It should be easy for you to fulfil a little wish for me ...

"WHAT? You want to rebuild the ancient tomb? Did I hear you right? 
That is a huge project indeed! And not without problems, even though, as you say, the welfare of all mankind depends on it.

You should know that we have built a nice park for our citizens on the spot where the tomb used to be. For rest and relaxation. And this park is my beloved wife's favourite spot!

<usericon:1,234,293>

She will be so upset if I tear down the park! She would never forgive me!
