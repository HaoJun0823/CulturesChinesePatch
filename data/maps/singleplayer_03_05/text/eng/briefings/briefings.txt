INTIHUATANA

[blockend:header]

[blockstart:00]
After a long trek full of privation through the desert, the Vikings finally reached this bleak spot. They were obviously hopelessly lost, even though their intended destination had to be nearby - a fertile, green oasis where they could live happily.

At least there were useful treasure chests in this place ... The Vikings decided to recover their strength here before they continued their search for the promised land ...

THE OASIS

At last the oasis appeared before the Vikings.
It was a green and blossoming spot in the middle of this bleak country.

They decided to stay here and set up camp. However, they had to be quick about producing something to eat, for food was in short supply - and hunger was a bad friend ...


NOTE:
You have a few useful papers among your luggage that should help you along ... 
Once you have secured the food supply, you can continue playing as you like - there is no victory objective in this mission.

THE DESERT PEOPLE

"What are you doing in our country, strangers? This is Intihuatana, the mooring place of the sun!

Leave now, we do not trust strangers. Have you come to raid our tombs? If so - be warned that we will stop you!"


NOTE:
You will surely be able to convince this tribe of your honesty by paying a small tribute - maybe your tribe and this one will even become friends someday!

PEACE

The Vikings had given the desert people a valuable present, and this convinced them of their honesty! However, some of the desert dwellers still doubted them and prevented the conclusion of a friendly alliance. 

A further tribute was bound to appease them - and eliminate the last obstacles to a trade agreement ...

TRADE OFFER

"We are happy to welcome you as our honoured neighbours! From now on, we will trade with you and offer you good prices!"
[blockend:04]

[blockstart:05]

CALL FOR HELP

"Help! The final resting place of our greatest king is under attack by grave robbers!

<usericon:1,163,446>

We can't defend this place alone ... Is there no one able and willing to drive the robbers from our holy shrine?"
[blockend:05]

[blockstart:06]

GRAVE ROBBERS

"The treasures of this place are now ours! 

Be gone, or will we teach you the meaning of fear!"
[blockend:06]

[blockstart:07]

GRAVE ROBBERS' DEFEAT

The grave robbers had been defeated. The Vikings were celebrated gratefully in Intihuatana ...
[blockend:07]

[blockstart:08]

MERCHANT

"Welcome to this place of trade and exchange! We are peaceful neighbours, and you may purchase our treasures!"
[blockend:08]

[blockstart:09]

MERCHANT DIED

Why did your Vikings kill the harmless merchant?

Well, that puts a stop to all trade opportunities!
[blockend:09]

[blockstart:10]

DESERT PEOPLE DESTROYED

The Vikings have destroyed the desert tribe, though these people were only wary and could almost certainly have been persuaded ... 

But you have decided on the way of war! It is doubtful whether Odin will be pleased ...
[blockend:10]

[blockstart:11]

The Vikings have left this world! So then must this mission end!
[blockend:11]

[blockstart:12]

THE TREASURE OF THE INTIHUATANA

The grave robbers have been defeated. Their legacy - the treasure of the Intihuatana - now belongs to the Vikings!
[blockend:12]

[blockstart:13]

The grave robbers have been defeated. But who may now claim this place of peace?
[blockend:13]

[blockstart:14]

THE DESERT PEOPLE

"We welcome you to our land, strangers. This is Intihuatana, the mooring place of the sun!

Aren't you the ones who warded off the cowardly attack of the grave robbers? 

We thank you for your deeds and will open our trade posts to you! You and your merchants will always be welcomed here!"
[blockend:14]

[blockstart:15]

DESERT PEOPLE DESTROYED

The Vikings have eliminated the desert tribe, even though these people had offered them friendship ... 

But you have decided on the way of war! It is doubtful whether Odin will be pleased ...
