[blockstart:01_landed] 
There were good landing places on the shores of the island. We chose a small bay in the west to disembark. It was very quiet and peaceful, a silent magic rested here ...

Moor the ship and let your people explore the area!

UNICORN

In a clearing we met a bright and shining creature. It was as beautiful as something out of a fairytale, dazzling to our eyes. In its quiet and friendly language the unicorn told us that we were welcome, and that it would give us a magic horn of the unicorns if we solved the riddle surrounding this place. 
It was like a dream - we understood every word without knowing the language ... 

Answer the oracle!
