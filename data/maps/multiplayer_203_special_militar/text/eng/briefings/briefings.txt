LAND OF THE DRAGONS II

[blockend:header]

[blockstart:begin_00]
The chieftain of a local tribe has asked for help:

"The land of the dragons has been attacked by wolf creatures! I fear they plan to set the dragons free that we fought so hard to drive back into their caves and trap there!

Fight the wolves. Quickly, before they release the dragons!"


Every team that joins the wolf hunt starts out with three useful papers. 
Also, new soldiers will enter the game at the starting position at regular intervals, to make sure you have sufficient reinforcements in case of losses.

You can find vital equipment in the many hidden treasure chests that will appear now and then ...


Now go out and hunt, it's time to save the land of the dragons!
The winner must be the first to defeat 100 opponents!


Hint:
If you capture one of the five immortal holy raincows that live here, you can change the weather as often as you like! If a player manages to capture a raincow from another player, the new owner of the raincow is the weathermaker!


Another hint:
From time to time, switches will appear for you to use ... They disappear again after a few minutes, so hurry up and push one when you see them! 

Some switches activate mechanisms in the same location, others affect your warehouses.
