THE COMPETITION
[blockend:header]

[blockstart:00_start] 
The runner of Elis was in good shape and it wasn't going to be easy for Sigurd to beat him in the competition! 

<usericon:1,22,119>

But still - he had to try because if he won the race, the citizens of Olympia and Elis would give us their support ...
