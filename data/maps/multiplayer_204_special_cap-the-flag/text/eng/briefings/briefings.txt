FOUR SEASONS

[blockend:header]

[blockstart:begin_00]
Welcome to the land of the four seasons!


This is where players compete for domination over a string of islands. The aim is to protect your own flags, while at the same time capturing those of your opponents.

Every player has five flags to protect. Four of these are always on the player's own island, the last is on an uninhabited neighbouring island.

If you lose all five of these flags, you're out! There is a possibility to ransom your flags by paying tributes - but it's not cheap ...

The last person to still have their flags can proudly call themselves the "Lord (or Lady) of the Land and Climate"!


Hint:
There is quite a lot to discover in this country. You may also meet merchants who have something on offer ...

A FLAG HAS BEEN CAPTURED!

Flags can be ransomed by paying tributes! Merchants near the centre of the map will make offers when you find them.

There are different tributes that ransom one or two flags. The tribute for ransoming at least three flags is higher.


In other words, if you don't ransom one (or two) flag(s) in time, you will have to pay a much higher tribute when another one is captured!
