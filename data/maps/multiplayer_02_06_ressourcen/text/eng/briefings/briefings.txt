WINTER IS HERE

[blockend:header]

[blockstart:begin_00]
It is the beginning of a new age. Four Viking tribes have set up new homes on a wide terrain. There is ample room and enough resources for everyone. 
The tribes enjoy a peaceful coexistence, and there is really no need for them to fight ... 

There's a lot to do before the cold of winter sets in: You must gather certain resources to produce the following goods:
80 coins
25 longswords
50 big nourishing potions

The first tribe to accumulate all the required goods wins.
