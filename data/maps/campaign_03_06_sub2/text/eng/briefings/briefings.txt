THE SEA OF FLAMES
[blockend:header]

[blockstart:00_start] 
An inhospitable area opened up underneath the barracks. This was the former basement of the Spartans!

But how this place must have changed! They seemed to have built their city on a volcano.

Reach the artefact. Beware of fire-spewing rockfaces!

MISSION COMPLETED! 
[blockend:50_endheader]
[blockstart:50_end] 
We made it! Finally, we were holding the artefact in our hands and could leave the Sea of Flames. 

And we did not want to stay another minute!

BASEMENT GUARD

"These warehouses used to be full, but now the rockfaces are cracked and fire is coming out of the gaps. All ways to the warehouses are blocked.

<usericon:1,100,55>

The switches that used to open the gates to the warehouses have all gone rusty except one. But what can a flyweight like me do ..."

WARNING!

The flames have already claimed a fair number of heroes' lives!

[blockstart:03] 
FLAMES PUT OUT!

Together we managed to operate the switch, but no door opened! A strong draught flowed through the halls, blowing out the flames for a while.

SWITCH OPERATED

Although we had managed to operate the switch, it had no effect.

SWITCH

This switch showed no effect. Maybe the power of only one switch wasn't enough ...
