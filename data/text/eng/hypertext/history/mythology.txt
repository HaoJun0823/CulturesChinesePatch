THE_SEVEN_WONDERS_OF_THE_WORLD 
[blockend:0_uberschrift]	

[blockstart:0_text_0]
In the first quarter of the 3rd century B.C., people began to form groups of seven. Among other things, the list with the seven most impressive technical achievements of the artistic circle around the Aegean Sea was drawn up. This original list consisted of one Egyptian, two Babylonian and four Greek Wonders of the World: the Pyramids of Giza, the Ramparts of Babylon, the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis in Babylon, the Zeus Statue of Phidias in Olympia, the Artemis Temple in Ephesus, the marble Mausoleum in Halicarnassus and  the Helios Colossus of Rhodes. 
\n
\n
At the time when the list was drawn up, the Lighthouse of Pharos - today known as the Seventh Wonder of the World - did not yet exist. In the second oldest and nowadays common list of the Wonders of the World, it replaces the mighty Ramparts of Babylon.
The frequently mentioned Tower of Babylon does not appear in any of the original lists. At the beginning of the third century B.C. it was no longer in existence.
In the later, altered lists of Wonders, the Labyrinth, the Euphrates Bridge, the Persian Palace and others were added. In the course of time, other lists of Wonders were drawn up, consisting of up to 50 Wonders of the World like e.g. the Pergamon Altar, the Roman Colosseum or the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.
\n
\n
The nowadays accepted catalogue of the Seven Wonders of the World dates back to the Greek writer Antipater of Sidon in the second century B.C. It is therefore not the oldest, but the slightly amended second oldest list:
\n
\n
<block:2>
Pyramids of Giza\nGiza, Egypt (around 2590-2470 B.C.)
\n\n
Zeus Statue of Phidias\nOlympia, Greece (5th century B.C.)
\n\n
Temple of Artemis\nEphesus, Turkey (6th century B.C.)
\n\n
Tomb of Mausolos\nHalicarnassus, Turkey (around 325 B.C.)
\n\n
Hanging Gardens of Babylon\nBabylon, Iraq (date of origin unknown;
probably built by Nebuchadnezzar II around 604-562 B.C.)
\n\n
Colossus of Rhodes\nRhodes, Greece (292-282 B.C.)
\n\n
Lighthouse of Pharos\nAlexandria, Egypt (270 B.C.)
\n
\n

Apart from the Pyramids of Giza, all the Wonders of the World have been destroyed.

[blockend:1_uberschrift]	

[blockstart:1_text_0]
>Out of all the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Lighthouse of Alexandria is the only one that also had a practical use apart from its architectural significance. It guaranteed safe entrance into the harbour for sailors. However, for architects it had a greater meaning: It was the tallest building in the world. Its light could be seen from a distance of more than 50 kilometres.
\n
[blockend:1_text_0]	

[blockstart:1_text_1]
The Pharos Lighthouse is often referred to as the so-called "Eighth Wonder of the World". After its completion and inauguration in 279 B.C. it was added to the original list of Wonders. It replaced the city walls of Babylon. However, in some lists the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis are occasionally left out instead.
\n
\n
The island of Pharos off the coast of Alexandria was linked to the mainland by a dam with water passageways which was at that time technically important - the so-called "Heptastadium" of Dexiphanes of Knidos. Sostratos, son of Dexiphanes of Knidos, was the architect of the mighty Lighthouse that was built on the island.
\n
\n
A high basement rose on a foundation of 30x30 square metres that was narrower towards the top. A path with tritons at the four corners was left, and a less high second storey was built on top as an octagonal prism. On top of that was a small cylindrical third storey. Finally, the crowned bronze statue of Zeus Soter was placed on its conical roof as a symbol of welfare for the sailors. The overall height of the relatively narrow tower amounted to 113 metres.
\n
\n
In the 14th century, the Lighthouse was finally destroyed by an earthquake. Later, the Fort of Kait Bey was built on its foundations.

The Hanging_Gardens_of_Semiramis
[blockend:2_uberschrift]	

[blockstart:2_text_0]
In the circulating records, the Hanging Gardens were often mentioned in connection with the legendary Assyrian-Babylonian Semiramis (around 775 B.C.) and thus named after her. The oldest source, the work "Persica" by the royal physician Ktesias (around 400 B.C.), however, stresses explicitly that the elaborate Gardens were not built by Semiramis, but by a king of a later time.
\n
[blockend:2_text_0]	

[blockstart:2_text_1]
Besides the date and the designer, another thing that is not known about the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is their exact location. Among the possible designers were Nebuchadnezzar II, Syros, Semiramis II or Cyrus. The clever ways to draw water are mentioned again and again in the records. That is why the Hanging Gardens are probably near the southern fortress of Nebuchadnezzar II. The excavations in the old riverbed of the Euphrates, close to the southern fortress, uncovered the ruins of a bulwark made of tiles and asphalt mortar that once formed an ostentatious western protection against the waves of the river Euphrates. The bulwark that ran from north to south on the eastern bank of the Euphrates was shaped like a rectangle of approximately 197.5x106.5 square metres, with two fortifications in the west. The nearly square southern part would have provided enough space for the construction of a considerably large creation of a special kind. It is also possible that the entrenchment was not converted into the Hanging Gardens until later, when the Persian kings (Dareios II Nothos - 425-404 B.C., and Mnemon - 404-361 B.C.) were in Babylon.
\n
\n
Apparently, the square southern part of the Euphrates trenchwork was crowned by the stepped-pyramid construction skeleton of a 25 to 30 metre-high artificial mountain terrace with a base side measuring 100 metres. The thick walls and pillars of this skeleton were mostly made out of tiles. Flattened or vaulted paths were said to have stretched below the individual steps over a width of 3 metres. The cover above the ceiling beams of the individual storeys consisted of a base of pipes with plenty of asphalt, with a double layer of tiles embedded in gypsum mortar on top, and a third layer of lead plates. This prevented the dampness of the scattered humus from seeping through to the depths of the paths. Various trees were planted in the humus floor.

The_Colossus_of_Rhodes
[blockend:3_uberschrift]	

[blockstart:3_text_0]
After the defeat of Kypros in the years 305/304 B.C., King Demetrios Poliorketes, the great city conqueror of the Alexandrine era, wanted to conquer the favourably located port of Rhodes that was flourishing at that time. After a long unsuccessful siege, he finally gave up his plan. The people of Rhodes thereupon honoured their patron saint Helios with a giant statue carved in his image.
\n
[blockend:3_text_0]	

[blockstart:3_text_1]
The Colossus of Rhodes was finished about 290 B.C. after a construction time of 12 years. Chares, a citizen of Lindos, declared himself responsible for the construction financed by selling the rest of the siege material that had been left over. Several sources say that the Colossus was built at a height of 80 ells (approx. 35 metres). The bronze image of the god supposedly sat on a triangular white marble pedestal. The notion that the Colossus stood straddling the entrance to the harbour, holding a flaming torch in his upraised right hand, does not correspond to the popular records. Instead, the reports tell of only one base (thus the god's legs cannot have been parted), and of a location in the middle of the city.
\n
\n
66 years after its completion (around 224 B.C.), the statue collapsed during an earthquake and broke at the knees. Due to the oracle's wisdom "What lies well should not be moved", the Colossus was indeed left lying on the ground for almost 900 years. An old record of Pliny says: "Even lying on the ground, it is a marvel. Few people can make their arms meet round its thumbs, and its fingers are larger than most statues."
\n
\n
After the conquest of the island by the Arabs in 653 A.D., the lower part of the Colossus that was still standing was pulled down from its marble pedestal, and the whole ore mass was brought to Edessa to be melted down.

The_Tomb_of_Mausolos
[blockend:4_uberschrift]	

[blockstart:4_text_0]
In Halicarnassus, located in the south-western coastal region of Asia Minor, King Mausolos built a new residence with a palace and a temple complex. On a broad road that ran above the semicircular structure, a huge square was built that Mausolos always intended to use as his royal monumental tomb. The word "mausoleum" to describe a tomb was later derived from this.
\n

[blockend:4_text_0]	

[blockstart:4_text_1]
The rectangular excavation pit of the Mausoleum that was found embedded in the stony ground had a surface of 39x33 square metres. Above the underground foundation stood the base construction, the Krepidoma, which was several storeys high. On top rested not the peripteral house, as was usually the case with Greek temples, but the multi-levelled based was continued in a massive prismatic body of about 33 metres in length and almost 27 metres in height, resulting in an overall base height of almost 22 metres. The top was crowned with the temple, measuring about 13 metres high and accommodating the "Pteron", a colonnade of 36 Asian-Ionic columns around the big centre; Asian-Ionic stone beams rounded off the construction. Above the temple rose a pyramid-like 9 metre-high roof consisting of 24 steps and a platform that held a marble four-horsed chariot with a height of 5 metres, including its own pedestal. The overall height of the Mausoleum amounted to 49 metres.
\n
\n
In 377 B.C., Mausolos moved to Halicarnassus. After 24 years on the throne, he died childless in the year 353 B.C. His unfinished tomb was first continued by his sister Artemisia, whom he was also married to. Two years later, the construction began to falter when Artemisia also died. It was only when Alexander the Great took care of the project in 334 B.C. that the Wonder could be finished.
\n
\n
Finally, in the 13th century, the tomb collapsed during an earthquake, and from the 15th century, in times of emergency and danger, the Knights of St. John used the material to build the defensive port fortress of Petronia, today known as Fort Budrum.

The_Temple_of_Artemis
[blockend:5_uberschrift]	

[blockstart:5_text_0]
As early as 1398 B.C., a building with 4 columns was placed on the site of the later Artemis Temple to hold the image of a goddess that was said to have fallen from the sky. 
\n
[blockend:5_text_0]	

[blockstart:5_text_1]
After about 560 / 550 B.C., this building was transformed into a giant temple, after having been destroyed and expanded several times. After the end of the Persian wars, around 440 B.C., the Temple was almost finished by Demetrios and Paionios from Ephesus, so that the construction works lasted for 120 years altogether. In 356 B.C., the magnificent site was burnt down by Herostratos, an insignificant citizen from Ephesus who had an obsessive desire to earn fame. At least the holy image of the goddess Artemis could be saved. Apparently, this gave the citizens of Ephesus the motivation to build a new home for the celestial image of the goddess. The new Artemis Temple was far more magnificent than its predecessor, and was later listed among the Seven Wonders of the World.
\n
\n
Cheirokrates, an architect from Ephesus, took care of the planning, the organisation and the reconstruction. The debris of the collapsed building was used as a new foundation. The massive centre was filled up and smoothed out before being extended to a platform with an area of 125.67 x 65.05 square metres and a height of 2 metres by building a massive framework covered with marble. On this new foundation they built a construction that was to correspond exactly to the destroyed temple with regard to its basic plan and the arrangement of the columns. 127 columns, each with a height of at least 18 metres, are said to have been used for this. 
\n
\n
During the reign of the Great Roman Empire in Ephesus (after 133 A.D.), the Greek Artemis became the Roman Diana. After much plundering and pillaging during the time of the Goths (262 / 263 A.D.) and total destruction under Constantine the Great after the time of the Seljuks and the Osmano Turks (13th and 15th century), the remains disappeared in the constantly rising swamps.

Zeus_Statue_of_Phidias_in_Olympia 
[blockend:6_uberschrift]	

[blockstart:6_text_0]
A consecrated site existed on the Peleponnes peninsular at the river Alpheios in the area of Elis since as early as the second millennium. A cult image of Zeus Areios, measuring about 4 metres in height, sat in the ancient temple of Hera on the festival square at the foot of the Kronos Hill. After the Persian wars had passed and with the following political progress, the people felt the desire to build their own mighty Zeus temple as a national shrine. Around 457 B.C., a typically Doric temple was built at the then important Hellenic place of worship.
\n
[blockend:6_text_0]	

[blockstart:6_text_1]
Libon, an architect from the neighbouring city of Elis, built a church from white stone that was placed on three high pedestals and surrounded by 34 Doric columns. The temple covered an area of 30.30 x 66.74 square metres and had a height of around 24 metres up to its ridge, including the Nike Acroterion of Paionios. This became the site for the image of Zeus that was later created (around 438 / 432 B.C.) by the Greek Phidias. 
\n
\n
The enthroned figure of Zeus stood on a limestone plinth and was about seven times as tall as a man (about 12 metres). The mighty centre of this colossal structure was made from cypress and ebony. The naked body parts (face, neck, arms, hands and feet) were artfully modelled and carved in ivory. The soles of the sandals, the ankle-length robe of the god and the flowing hair were made of pure gold! In his outstretched right hand, Zeus held a floating, slim Nike; the left hand held a sceptre made out of various precious metals and crowned by the golden eagle. The golden stool beneath the god's feet held an inscription of the artist: "Phidias, son of Charmides from Athens, created me."
\n
\n
The Zeus temple with the famous Zeus Statue was about 80 meters away from the arena in Olympia. The athletes made sacrifices to their god before the competitions and took the oath of fair play.
\n
\n
During the Olympic Games (from 776 B.C. to 394 A.D.) that were held every four years, no arms were carried. Only men participated in the Games; women were excluded - even from the audience, as the men competed in the nude. The best athletes were determined in the disciplines of discus throwing, running, javelin, wrestling and the long jump - the winner was crowned with a laurel wreath. After the emperor Theodosius prohibited the Games, the temple too was closed in 426 A.D. Nobody knew what happened to the Statue. However, stone, marble and gold were often taken and used to create other works of art.
\n
\n
Despite its beauty and magnificent decorations, the Statue of Zeus is probably the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that was added to the list not because of its design, but because of its unbelievable aura as a kind of father of the gods and the people. "We look at the other Wonders of the World in amazement, but this one we adore," Philion of Byzantium wrote in an ancient travel guide.

Pyramids_of_Giza 
[blockend:7_uberschrift]	

[blockstart:7_text_0]
The Pyramids of Giza were built in the days of the Fourth Dynasty by the kings Cheops, Chepren and Mycerinus (2590 - 2470 B.C.). The Pyramids of Cheops and Chepren are the tallest buildings of the entire antiquity, and were e.g. one third taller than the Tower of Babylon. 
\n
[blockend:7_text_0]	

[blockstart:7_text_1]
With a square base area of a side length of 230.36 metres, the Pyramid of Cheops was originally 146.60 metres high. The Pyramid of Chepren originally measured 143.50 metres in height, with a side length of 215.26 metres.
\n
\n
Apparently, each of the Pyramids only contained one burial chamber of a very modest size - compared to the giant volume of the Pyramids. The chamber was either built in the rocky subsoil, on the same height as the Pyramid's base, or in the gravitational centre of the structure's stone mass. Only the burial chamber in the Pyramid of Cheops, in addition to the access tunnel, was connected to the outside world by narrow ventilation shafts (20 x 20 square centimetres). After the burial of the mummy in the burial chamber, the access tunnel was walled up for good, so that nobody could tell where the entrance was.
\n
\n
Over the years, the construction of the Pyramids continued during the three months of the Nile inundations (from the middle of August until the middle of November), during which time the Egyptian farmers usually had no work to do. After building up the centre of a pyramid to serve as a large staircase with four fronts, the big terraces were interspersed from one storey to another by homogeneous layers. Initially, this resulted in a layered structure that could be climbed from all sides until the outer surfaces of the Pyramid were smoothed out from top to bottom, so that they finally sparkled in the sun like giant crystals or gleamed mysteriously under the stars at night in the glaring moonlight. The Pyramid of Cheops was once surfaced with snow-white limestone that had been thoroughly mortised and unshakeably fixed. However, as the outer layer was later used for the building of Cairo, the Pyramids nowadays are merely uncovered step pyramids.
